  ## üåê Web Application Development

To ensure **accessibility**, **scalability**, and **ease of use** for both technical and non-technical users, a lightweight yet powerful web-based application was developed for **real-time guava leaf disease diagnosis**. The application serves as the front-end interface for the trained deep learning models, allowing users to upload or capture leaf images and receive instant feedback, complete with confidence scores and Grad-CAM visual explanations.


### üß∞ Tools & Frameworks Used

| Category | Tool / Framework | Purpose |
|-----------|------------------|----------|
| **Backend Framework** | **Flask (Python)** | Serves as the core backend framework for integrating trained deep learning models, handling user requests, and managing inference pipelines. Flask was chosen for its simplicity, speed, and easy deployment. |
| **Frontend Framework** | **HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap** | Used to design a responsive, mobile-friendly interface. Bootstrap ensured consistent design across devices, while custom CSS provided a clean, modern aesthetic for usability. |
| **Model Integration** | **PyTorch / TensorFlow** | Enabled smooth loading and inference of pre-trained models such as YOLOv11, DenseNet201, and EfficientNetB3 for image classification and localization. |
| **Visualization** | **Grad-CAM & Matplotlib** | Used to generate explainable AI visualizations, showing heatmaps that highlight the image regions influencing model predictions. |
| **Data Handling** | **Pandas & NumPy** | Managed backend data operations, result aggregation, and performance tracking. |
| **Web Deployment** | **Streamlit / Flask Hosting / Render / Localhost** | Depending on deployment environment, Streamlit was used for rapid prototyping, while Flask-based deployment was prepared for scalable hosting (e.g., on Render or Heroku). |
| **Image Processing** | **OpenCV & Pillow (PIL)** | Used for preprocessing user-uploaded images‚Äîresizing, normalization, and format conversion‚Äîto ensure consistency with model input requirements. |



### ‚öôÔ∏è Application Workflow

1. **User Uploads Image** ‚Äì The application accepts images captured via smartphone or webcam.  
2. **Model Inference** ‚Äì The backend loads the optimized CNN or YOLOv11 model to predict disease class and confidence score.  
3. **Explainability Layer** ‚Äì Grad-CAM visualizations are generated to highlight disease-affected areas.  
4. **Results Display** ‚Äì Users receive diagnosis results, confidence levels, and corresponding heatmap visualizations in real time.  
5. **Recommendations (Optional)** ‚Äì The app provides disease-specific prevention and management suggestions.
